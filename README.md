# Quizzle
The official source code for Quizzle


## Getting started...
cd to the project directory, and run `npm install` just to make sure all dependencies are met, then run `npm run server`, and it should work!
**First thing to do after installation is to go to /signIn and sign in with the `admin` account, it has a default password of `adminUserQUIZ123.`, then click `Change Password` and set it to something different.**

### NOTE:
This is currently still in beta. There could be some bugs, and some potential vulnerabilities, but I am constantly reviewing every endpoint for vulnerabilities like XSS and HPP, and every input is sanitized.

If you find a bug, report it to @shrekman#5545 privately or report it the the #bug-report channel in https://discord.gg/4VDmfuBSFf
